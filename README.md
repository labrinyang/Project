<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Modify config in `config.py`.
2. Define the graphon in `continuous_W()` in `run.py`.
3. Run the simulation:
```
python run.py
```
4. To visualize the random walk on a demo for `N=5` nodes and `T=5`, run:
```
python demo.py
``` 
Note that the demo is a GIF.
